# About The Project

This Project contains all the practicals `source code` for the computer science batch of Kerala Syllabus. So being a computer science student and knowing that there was no github repo for the practicals was kind of sad. So thats way this is created.

## Installation üíª

#### Linux Users.

If you are on Ubuntu you should be fine because that's what our schools use, just get the files and run it thats it on your IDE.
uses

**`Geany IDE used in schools`** [ Download](https://www.geany.org/)

#### Windows Users.

Setting a C++ or mySQL workspace on a windows machine is a huge pain in the üòµ . So what i recommend you do is, going online and finding an IDE is much more easy and will work perfectly fine.

Some good ones that i found :

> C++ IDE online

- [cpp.sh](http://cpp.sh/)

- [onlinegdb.com](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler)

## Provided files and structure

So basically in our syllabus we have 25 Practicals, Which are divided like:

- C++
  - 10 C++ Practicals
- HTML
  - 8 html with javascript Practicals
- PHP
  - 2 php practicals
- mySQL
  - 5 mySQL database practicals

#### Todo :

- [ ] If the syllabus gets a change feel free to add or remove the necessary files. üëç

## End Goal ‚ù§Ô∏è

My main Goal was to provide the `code files` so that students can get them easily at the time of exams
